# OHBM 2024 Generative Models
Notebook and data for generative models tutorial at OHBM 2024 (Seoul).

A few notes. This tutorial uses the following libraries and you will need them installed:
1. [numpy[(https://numpy.org/)
2. [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
3. [networkx](https://networkx.org/)
4. [scipy](https://scipy.org/)

The tutorial also references human connectome data. These data come from [here](https://zenodo.org/records/2872624) where they were further post-processed into a group-representative matrix using the approach described in [Betzel et al](https://direct.mit.edu/netn/article/3/2/475/2219/Distance-dependent-consensus-thresholds-for).

An up-to-date version of the lecture slides is available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ijid2v2r0ibqg444hjpso/betzel-ohbm2024-educational_workshop-generative_models.pptx?rlkey=aictlbutwivfk7v3yw3myb5zk&dl=0).
